A straightforward ray tracer, with several scenes available for manual selection in raytracer.cpp, can be compiled and output to a generated raytracer.ppm file by running the provided run.sh script.

Note that the file compiles using GCC, and the bash script attempts to open the .ppm file using GIMP. You can edit this to serve whatever purpose you want; that's just what I used.
